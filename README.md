# support_vector_machine_implementation
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and compares the performance of three kernels — Linear, Polynomial, and RBF — on a sample dataset. The implementation includes 2D and 3D decision boundary visualizations, accuracy analysis, and insights into kernel-specific behavior.
